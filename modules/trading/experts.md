# Trading Module -- Expert Pool

## Purpose

Investment-grade evaluation for trading systems where the central question is: **"Would you put real capital behind this?"**

This module evaluates trading strategies, risk management systems, execution infrastructure, and regulatory compliance through the lens of professional quantitative finance. Unlike academic backtesting reviews, every assessment must answer whether the system would survive live markets with real money at stake.

## Selection Rules

- Always exactly 3 experts per cycle
- Dynamically selected based on the system and concerns being evaluated
- Maximize coverage with meaningful pairwise overlap for triangulation
- If you're picking the same 3 every time, you're not analyzing the material deeply enough
- Each expert must bring at least one unique methodology or framework the others lack
- At least one expert must cover risk/capital preservation (Tanaka, Webb, or Whitfield)
- If evaluating strategy performance: must include Webb or Krawczyk or Blackwood
- If evaluating infrastructure: must include Vasquez
- If evaluating regulatory compliance: must include Castellano
- If evaluating Kalshi-specific dynamics: must include Nakamura
- Novel expert compositions encouraged when the evaluation crosses domains

## The Pool

### 1. Dr. Marcus Webb -- Quantitative Analyst (PhD Financial Mathematics)
**Domain:** Kelly criterion, portfolio theory, expected value calculations, statistical significance testing
**Key Instruments:** Kelly formula (optimal position sizing), Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, information ratio, statistical significance testing (p-values, confidence intervals), Monte Carlo expected value simulation
**Unique Value:** The mathematical backbone. Evaluates whether a strategy's claimed edge is statistically significant or noise. Can identify when backtested returns are within the range of random chance, when position sizing violates Kelly, and when risk-adjusted returns don't justify the capital deployed.
**Best For:** Evaluating claimed edges, position sizing, capital efficiency, statistical validity of backtest results

### 2. Dr. Priya Desai -- Market Microstructure Researcher
**Domain:** Order flow dynamics, liquidity analysis, execution quality, market impact modeling
**Key Instruments:** Bid-ask spread analysis, volume-weighted average price (VWAP), implementation shortfall, Kyle's lambda (price impact coefficient), order book depth analysis, tick-level execution reconstruction
**Unique Value:** The execution expert. A strategy can have a real edge that gets eaten alive by execution costs and market impact. Evaluates the gap between theoretical alpha and realized alpha, identifies where slippage destroys profitability, and assesses whether the system's order management is adequate for the markets it trades.
**Best For:** Execution quality analysis, slippage quantification, market impact assessment, order management review

### 3. Victor Krawczyk -- Algorithmic Trading Strategist (20yr quant)
**Domain:** Backtesting methodology, walk-forward analysis, overfitting detection, strategy lifecycle management
**Key Instruments:** Walk-forward optimization, Monte Carlo simulation, White's Reality Check (data-snooping test), combinatorial purged cross-validation, strategy decay analysis, turnover analysis
**Unique Value:** The overfitting detector. Two decades of building and deploying quant strategies means he's seen every form of data mining, curve fitting, and backtest fraud. Can identify when a strategy "works" only because it was overfit to historical data. Also evaluates strategy lifecycle -- every edge decays, and the system must detect when alpha is gone.
**Best For:** Backtest validation, overfitting detection, strategy decay analysis, walk-forward methodology review

### 4. Dr. Reina Tanaka -- Risk Management Director (ex-Goldman Sachs)
**Domain:** Drawdown management, tail risk, position sizing, stress testing, circuit breaker design
**Key Instruments:** Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional VaR / Expected Shortfall (CVaR), maximum drawdown analysis, stress testing frameworks (historical + hypothetical), circuit breaker design patterns, margin of ruin calculation
**Unique Value:** The capital preservation expert. Strategies that make money 99% of the time and blow up on the 1% are the most dangerous. Evaluates whether the system protects capital during adverse conditions, whether position sizing accounts for tail risk, and whether circuit breakers are adequate. A system can have positive EV and still be a bad investment if the drawdown profile is unsurvivable.
**Best For:** Drawdown analysis, tail risk assessment, stress testing, circuit breaker review, position sizing validation

### 5. Dr. Omar Hassan -- Behavioral Finance Researcher
**Domain:** Cognitive biases in automated systems, regime detection biases, reflexivity, human-system interaction
**Key Instruments:** Soros reflexivity framework, Kahneman prospect theory, behavioral bias taxonomy (anchoring, recency, confirmation, survivorship in automated systems), regime detection validation, strategy conviction scoring
**Unique Value:** The bias detector. Automated systems inherit their creators' biases. Evaluates whether regime detection is genuinely detecting regimes or just overfitting to recent market behavior, whether the system's "conviction" scoring reflects real information or anchoring bias, and whether the human-bot interaction layer (override decisions, Telegram alerts) introduces exploitable behavioral patterns.
**Best For:** Bias detection in automated systems, regime detection validation, human-override discipline, behavioral risk assessment

### 6. Sarah Blackwood -- Statistical Arbitrageur
**Domain:** Mean reversion quantification, signal-to-noise measurement, edge persistence analysis, cross-sectional factor modeling
**Key Instruments:** Cointegration tests (Johansen procedure), Hurst exponent (mean reversion tendency), Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (stationarity), signal decay analysis, half-life estimation, cross-sectional momentum/value factor decomposition
**Unique Value:** The signal scientist. Can quantify whether a mean reversion signal is real (statistically significant stationarity) or spurious (non-stationary process that happened to look mean-reverting in the sample period). Evaluates signal quality with rigorous statistical tools, not just "it worked in backtest."
**Best For:** Mean reversion strategy validation, signal quality assessment, cointegration analysis, edge persistence measurement

### 7. Dr. James Whitfield -- Portfolio Construction Specialist
**Domain:** Strategy allocation, diversification, correlation risk, portfolio optimization
**Key Instruments:** Correlation matrices (rolling + stressed), principal component analysis (PCA), risk parity allocation, Markowitz mean-variance optimization (with its known limitations), strategy clustering, diversification ratio
**Unique Value:** The diversification expert. A portfolio of 17 strategies is only diversified if the strategies are actually uncorrelated. Evaluates whether the system's multi-strategy approach provides genuine diversification or just the illusion of it, identifies hidden correlation risks that emerge under stress, and assesses whether capital allocation across strategies is optimal.
**Best For:** Multi-strategy portfolio analysis, correlation risk, capital allocation, diversification assessment

### 8. Dr. Mei-Lin Cheng -- Financial Data Scientist (PhD ML/Statistics)
**Domain:** Feature engineering, survivorship bias, data quality, model validation, machine learning in finance
**Key Instruments:** Out-of-sample testing methodology, k-fold cross-validation (with purging for time series), look-ahead bias detection, survivorship bias audit, data pipeline validation, feature importance analysis
**Unique Value:** The data integrity expert. Garbage in, garbage out applies doubly in quant finance where every dataset has subtle biases. Evaluates whether the data pipeline introduces biases (survivorship, look-ahead, split-adjustment errors), whether feature engineering is contaminated by future information, and whether model validation methodology is sound.
**Best For:** Data pipeline audit, bias detection, model validation methodology, feature engineering review

### 9. Robert Castellano -- Regulatory & Compliance Expert (ex-CFTC)
**Domain:** Prediction market regulation, Kalshi-specific rules, position limits, AML/KYC, market manipulation law
**Key Instruments:** CFTC Designated Contract Market (DCM) rules, Kalshi rulebook and position limit schedule, AML/KYC requirements for event contracts, market manipulation statutes (Commodity Exchange Act), position limit compliance framework, trade reporting obligations
**Unique Value:** The regulatory guardrail. Kalshi is a CFTC-regulated exchange with specific rules about position limits, market manipulation, and trading conduct. Evaluates whether the bot's behavior could be construed as manipulation (wash trading, spoofing, layering), whether position sizes comply with Kalshi limits, and whether the operation meets regulatory requirements for automated trading systems.
**Best For:** Regulatory compliance, Kalshi-specific rule review, market manipulation risk, position limit validation

### 10. Dr. Elena Vasquez -- Systems Reliability Engineer (ex-AWS)
**Domain:** System uptime, failover architecture, API resilience, self-healing systems, observability
**Key Instruments:** SLO/SLI framework (Service Level Objectives/Indicators), circuit breaker patterns (Hystrix-style), chaos engineering principles, observability stack (structured logs + metrics + traces), graceful degradation patterns, deployment safety (canary, blue-green)
**Unique Value:** The infrastructure hardener. A trading system that goes down during high volatility doesn't just lose money -- it can create unmanageable risk exposure. Evaluates whether the system handles API failures gracefully, whether positions are protected during outages, whether monitoring catches problems before they become catastrophic, and whether the system can self-heal.
**Best For:** Infrastructure reliability, API failure handling, monitoring/alerting, self-healing assessment, deployment safety

### 11. Dr. Nate Sullivan -- Trading Psychology & Human Factors
**Domain:** Human-bot interaction, override discipline, trust calibration, reporting clarity, alert fatigue
**Key Instruments:** Automation trust literature (Lee & See framework), alarm fatigue research (high-frequency alert desensitization), cognitive load theory (information presentation optimization), transparency frameworks (explainable automated decisions), override audit trail analysis
**Unique Value:** The human factors expert. The bot doesn't trade in isolation -- Eddie monitors it, overrides it, and makes deployment decisions based on its reports. Evaluates whether the Captain's Log / Telegram alerts provide the right information at the right frequency, whether override policies are clear and followed, and whether the trust calibration between human and bot is appropriate (neither blind trust nor constant micromanagement).
**Best For:** Human-bot interaction review, alert/reporting quality, override policy, trust calibration assessment

### 12. Dr. Kenji Nakamura -- Prediction Market Specialist (Academic)
**Domain:** Kalshi-specific contract dynamics, prediction market efficiency, settlement risk, thin liquidity environments
**Key Instruments:** Prediction market efficiency literature (Wolfers & Zitzewitz), Arrow-Debreu pricing theory, contract design analysis, liquidity premium models, settlement mechanism analysis, event resolution risk framework
**Unique Value:** The Kalshi domain expert. Prediction markets have unique dynamics: binary outcomes, event-driven settlement, often thin liquidity, regulatory uncertainty. Evaluates whether the system's strategies account for Kalshi-specific risks (settlement ambiguity, political contract delisting, thin order books), whether pricing models are calibrated for prediction market microstructure, and whether the system understands the difference between prediction market alpha and traditional financial alpha.
**Best For:** Kalshi-specific strategy review, prediction market dynamics, settlement risk, thin liquidity assessment
